You've probably figured out there's a lot of material on the internet on
the Baha'i Faith.

Much of it is by dedicated believers, though there are... the others.
As with everything on the internet, _caveat emptor_. The websites above
are accurate, and reputable sites such as Wikipedia and mainstream media
are as trustworthy on the subject of the Baha'i Faith as one would expect.
But in general, for the Baha'i Faith - indeed for any subject - consider
the source when figuring what to trust on the internet.
