The technology for this website was chosen to make event posting as "self-serve" as
possible, while allowing review of posted material and edits. You can sumbit posts
to the ATC and it will make its way to the website maintainers, but it will probably
be more convenient to learn how to construct and submit posts yourself.

Here's the steps for doing this.

## 1. Get a free GitHub account

GitHub is a standalone, Microsoft-owned free code repository much beloved by
many software developers. We're using it's web-publication framework (Git Pages).
You'll need to get a free github account to submit posts. To do that, just point
your browser to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and click on "Sign Up" in
the upper right corner. You'll then be allowed to create an account:

## 2. Go to the website "repository" at:

[https://github.com/westchesterbahai/westchesterbahai.github.io](https://github.com/westchesterbahai/westchesterbahai.github.io)

You'll see a lot of folders and files in here: 

![top-level-view](/images/2-top-level.png)

Click on the folder into which your announcement is going to go. The folder you put
it in will depend on the type of event you have:

**_childrens-class**: Posts announcing details of regularly-scheduled children's classes.

**_development**: Posts announcing service and social/economic development activites
of an ongoing nature, sponsored by the Baha'i community or individual Baha'is.

**_devotionals**: Posts announcing details of regularly-scheduled devotionals.

**_study-circle**: Posts announcing ongoing and upcoming study cirles.

**_youth-group**: Posts detailing information on a youth group.

**_special-events**: Posts announcing one-time events. This can also be used
for announcing special devotionals or workshops.

There are also a few other special folders:

**_posts**: This is for very important top-level announcements that should be
prominently displayed; e.g. that big holy day celebration that's coming up. Given
the profile of the event, you may instead want to put your post into the _drafts folder;
see below.

**_drafts**: If you want to check in a posting for review and aren't ready to post
it, put it into _drafts folder. Once it's been discussed, someone can put it into
publication by moving it to a different folder.

## 3. Now, time to create your post!

Once you're in the folder, click on the "Create new file" button:
(see ![new-files](/images/3-create-file.png)

## 4. You're ready to fill in the details! 

Type in the announcement, like so:

![add-file](/images/4-add-event.png)

A few important notes when you add your event announcment:

* The first few lines are *very important*. They are used by the website building
software to lay out and classify your posting. The sample posts shows how its done.
The first lines **must** start with this:

~~~~

    ---
    layout: posts
    title: [title of your web page]
    location: [town or city/village]
    description: [8-20 word description for the "front page"]
    time: [days and time]
    ---

~~~~

* The main body is the "ad copy" that your announcement will have. In addition to saying
what it is, key things to include are location, contact information, means of contact, and
days and times on which event is held.

* Contact information is the most important part of your announcement. I don't recommend
putting addresses of residences on the internet, so people need a way to find you.
Note that the sample post lists a phone number, but if you aren't comfortable posting
a phone number (I'm not), I suggest using Google Voice to get a special-purpose phone
number just for allowing people to call you. You can then forward to your phone to pick
it up. (Worst-case, you can always direct to 1-800-22-UNITE). If you want to provide an
email, create a special
purpose gmail or outlook account just for this account and have the email forwarded to
your regular email.

* This post doesn't have a social network feed, but if your ongoing group has one, this is
an excellent place to put it.

* Once you're done, you'll click on the button labeled "Commit new file." What this does
is puts the file in for review: the website maintainer will then review it, make edits if
necessary, and complete the posting process.

You're done! But now you need a way to edit it....

## Editing your post

To do this, you'll click on the pencil icon:

![edit](/images/5-edit-event.png)

This is the same sort of thing; once done editing, you'll "Commit," and the change will go
in for review.
