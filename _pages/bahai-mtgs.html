<p>This page lists Baha'i events for Baha'is. Most Baha'i events are open to the 
public, but there are a handful of events attended only by
Baha'is. These are the Feasts, in which we carry out our own discussions of
community governance, and the yearly unit conventions where deliberations take place on
the national level. There are also fundraising events that are occasionally closed, since
only Baha'is may contribute financially to Baha'i activities. 
<p><em>And what is a Baha'i?</em> Informally, it's anyone who calls themselves Baha'i. Actual membership
(or <em>enrollment</em>, as it is called in the Baha'i community) is not much more more complicated than that,
but is a formal declaration of acceptance of the mission of Baha'u'llah's,
the prophet and founder of the Baha'i Faith.
