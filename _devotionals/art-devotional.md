The theme for the next art devotional is "Movement and Change". We will be saying prayers and reading writings on change and transformation. We will be reflecting on transformative power of the arts to uplift society and to calm oneself. The beginning will include a dance/movement meditation that friends are welcome to participate in (cameras off if they are more comfortable with that!) and then we will create some art using any art supply of their choice. 
 
Feel free to invite any friends who are interested in the transformative power of the arts to uplift society!
 
Zoom link will be sent a few days before the event. Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for login information on how
