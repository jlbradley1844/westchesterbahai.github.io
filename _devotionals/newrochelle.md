The Local Spiritual Assembly of New Rochelle will be gathering to pray and read 
writings about equality, justice and peace. We will also discuss the July 22nd 2020 letter 
from the Universal House of Justice about racism in America. All are welcome!

Contact <atc@westchestebahais.org> for information on how
to join us.
