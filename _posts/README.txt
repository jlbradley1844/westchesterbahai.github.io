This is the top-level document collection. This is the list of the
objects that are going to go on the front page only. 
In general, your post will not go here. This is reserved for
"top level" announcements that will go directly on the front page
alongside the other sections of activities. Such announcements
are usually driven by the ATC, since they usually involve the
coordination of multiple communities.
