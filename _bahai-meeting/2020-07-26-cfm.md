Cluster Reflection meeting! We encourage those serving together - families, teams, tutors, 
devotional gathering hosts - to find a time to reflect on your learnings from this past 
month prior to the cluster-wide gathering.

This will be conducted via Zoom. Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for details.
