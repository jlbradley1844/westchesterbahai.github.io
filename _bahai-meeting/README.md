This is for posts announcing Baha'i only events. This helps give
transparency in the Baha'i community to those outside of it,
and allows Baha'is from out of the area to quickly find important
events like feasts and cluster reflection meetings. Such meetings
are not on the front page, since it is only of interest to
already-enrolled Baha'is,

This is also a good place for deepenings and trainings which are
not of interest
to the greater community. This should be very unusual
and specific in nature; e.g. institutional or LSA training.
