Our aim in reaching out to you is to invite you to join this study circle aimed at elevating 
the conversation of race within our communities.  We will start this journey by re-reading the 
most recent letter from the Universal House of Justice (dated July 22, 2020) and will then 
move to a deep-dive study of The Advent of Divine Justice.  We will dedicate these study 
groups to the writings on race and understanding the role we all play as Americans, and as 
Bahaâ€™is in America in eliminating racism and anti-blackness from our communities. 

This workshop is intended for Baha'is and friends of the Baha'i Faith. Click on the above
