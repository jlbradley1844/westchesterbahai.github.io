An opportunity to pray, read writings on the arts, and do some
of your own art therapy! No previous art experience or talent required!
Hosted by our friend Leonora.

Simply have your favorite art materials online. Colorful watercolor
paint and paper are recommended, but any art materials - even pencil
and paper - will work.

Open to all! Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for the Zoom link and
