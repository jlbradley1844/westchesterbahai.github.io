For this Art Devotional, we will
read interfaith writings, listen to inspiring music and create art together. Bring your favorite art supplies- anything that helps you relax, is therapeutic, and enjoyable. For me, it is watercolor and pen, for others it could be clay or just pencil on paper. Children and youth are welcome to join.

Open to all! Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for the Zoom link and
password.
