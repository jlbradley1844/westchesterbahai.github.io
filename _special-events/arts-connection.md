A peaceful opportunity to pray, read writings on the arts, and feel the 
healing and calming power of artmaking in these challenging times! No 
previous art experience required! Simply have your favorite art materials on 
hand. Some good therapeutic materials: clay, watercolor paint, large markers, 
or pastels. However, even crayons, pencil and paper could work!

Children and junior youth are welcome!

Open to all! Contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for the Zoom link and
