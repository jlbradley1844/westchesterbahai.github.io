For September, Race Amity of Northern Westchester and Putnam will
hold a zoom meeting.
Our discussion topic will be colorism, why it matters, and what we can do in our lives to help eliminate it.


RANWP meetings are temporarily online-only.
Please contact <atc@westchesterbahais.org> for the Zoom link and password.
A zoom link will be sent out the day before the meeting.
