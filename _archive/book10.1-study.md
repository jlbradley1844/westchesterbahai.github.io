This study circle is one of the "Ruhi" series of courses, book 10.1.
The subject is "Building Vibrant Communities."
This study circle will be held using Zoom during social-distancing times and further details to follow.

Should social-distancing be lifted during the summer, the meetings will continue in Scarsdale.

The service projects associated will be in family/household settings and online with your respective neighborhoods.
